/**
 * Where an appointment is in its lifecycle.
 *
 * Shared because both staff areas that show appointments have to agree on it:
 * the Secretary confirms and calls off; the Doctor completes and records a
 * no-show. `shared-appointment-status` maps these to badge tones, so a type per
 * area would mean a `no-show` rendering in a different colour depending on which
 * side of the desk you were sitting on.
 *
 * Note who is *not* here: nothing in the app creates an appointment. The patient
 * asks for a visit and the appointment arrives `booked`, which is what the
 * Secretary then confirms. Booking and moving a booked visit are therefore not
 * actions any role offers, rather than being an action this area forgot to
 * implement — see `SecretarySession.bookingRefusal` for the rules whoever does
 * create one has to satisfy.
 *
 * Each area re-exports this from its own models file, so pages keep importing
 * `AppointmentStatus` from where they always have.
