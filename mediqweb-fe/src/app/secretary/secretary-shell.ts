 *
 * The identity is read from the session rather than declared as a constant, so
 * editing the Profile page updates the name in the header. With a real AuthService
 * this becomes one read from the current user and nothing else changes.
 *
 * Page titles and breadcrumbs come from each route's `data.heading` rather than
 * from the page components, so a page never has to reach up to configure the
 * layout. For the same reason the layout's `[staffPageActions]` slot is not
 * available to pages: each page renders its own toolbar beneath the heading.
