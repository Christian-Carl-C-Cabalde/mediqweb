 * either confirms it or calls it off. Creating an appointment and moving a booked
 * one to a different time are not actions here at all, so there is no form, no
 * dialog and no state for either; `SecretarySession` does not expose the methods
 * that would perform them, so the absence is enforced below the view rather than
 * by it.
 *
 * Confirming is the Secretary's because it means "the patient said they are
 * coming", which is a phone call. Marking a visit complete and recording a no-show
 * stay the doctor's, so the two roles cover the lifecycle without both being able
 * to do the same thing.
 *
 * Scoped to the assigned doctor, so the page carries no doctor filter and no
 * doctor column: every row would say the same name.
