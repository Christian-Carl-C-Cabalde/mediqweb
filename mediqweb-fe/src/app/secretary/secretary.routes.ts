/**
 * Secretary area routes.
 *
 * Every page is its own lazy chunk. `data.heading` is what the shell reads to
 * fill in the layout's page title and breadcrumb, so a page never configures
 * the layout itself.
 *
 * The patient details heading is a special case: it should name the patient, not
 * the word "patient", and a name cannot be known until the id is in the URL. A
 * route resolver is the usual answer, but Angular skips resolution entirely when
 * no route on the tree declares a guard, so a resolver here would silently do
 * nothing. `headingFromPatient` instead tells the shell to fill the heading in
 * from the record, which always runs and cannot be left half-wired.
